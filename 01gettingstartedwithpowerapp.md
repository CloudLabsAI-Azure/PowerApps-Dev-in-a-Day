# Lab 01 - Getting started with Powerapps

## Estimated Duration: 40 Minutes

In this lab, you will set up your Power Platform development environment as part of the Prioritz fusion team. You will start by importing and reviewing solution components, including apps, flows, and tables, to understand the current state of the Prioritz solution. Next, you will enhance the solution by adding a new "My Notes" column to a table and updating the Prioritz Admin app to use this new field. Finally, you will verify that Visual Studio Code and the Power Platform CLI extension are installed and use the CLI to connect to your environment and list solutions. By completing these exercises, you will gain hands-on experience with solution management, app customization, and developer tools in the Power Platform ecosystem.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following :

- Exercise 1: Import and review solution components
- Exercise 2: Add a column for My Notes
- Exercise 3: Verify the pre-installed Visual Studio Code Installer and Power Platform CLI Extension

## Exercise 1 - Import, and review solution components

In this exercise, you will import the current solution into the pre-created dev environment and review the components of the solution. You will also run a flow that will add sample data to your environment, and test the applications in the solution.

>**Note:** The Dev environment is already pre-created as a part of the prerequisites.

### Task 1: Import, Review solution components and run flow

    >**Note:** Make sure the Environment URL value is copied along with the **https**. Your copied value should look like this `https://orgxxxxxx.crm.dynamics.com/`

    ![](images/L01/image37u-1.png)

5. In the LabVM, start **Visual Studio Code** using the shortcut available on the desktop.

   ![](images/L04/vscode1.png)
   
6. Click  on **Ellipsis** **(...) (1)** **Terminal (2)** and select **New Terminal (3)**.

    ![](images/8-8-25-l1-23.png)

7. Run the below command in the terminal.

   ```
   pac
   ```
   
   > **Info:** If you encounter an error after using the **pac** command, download the Power Platform CLI from the **https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI** link, 
     open   the installer, and complete the installation. Then, try the step again.

8. Replace `<your environment URL>` in the below command with the value of the environment URL that you copied earlier then run the command.

   ```
   pac auth create --name DevAuth --url <your environment URL>
   ```

   > **Info:** After adding the environment URL, the command will look like this: `pac auth create --name DevAuth--url https://org32172839283.crm.dynamics.com/`
  
    ![](images/L01/Eeditpac.png)

9. Complete the **Sign in** process, using the below credentials.

    > **Note:** If you're unable to see the **DeVAuth** profile, close Visual Studio Code and reopen it.

    > **Note:** If you are able to see the **Universal Profile** instead of **DeVAuth** profile, it is because of adding the incorrect **Environment URL** value in the **pac auth create** command in Step 9. To fix this issue, follow the below steps:

    > 1. Delete the **Universal Profile** from Visual Studio Code by clicking on the delete button.
    > 2. Copy the correct **Environment URL** value by following **Step 5** of this task. 
    > 3. Perform the **Step 9** of this task again to create the auth profile.

    ![](images/8-8-25-l1-23.png)

12. Run the command below to see a list of solutions.

      ```
      pac solution list
      ```
      
13. You should see a list of solutions installed on your environment.
