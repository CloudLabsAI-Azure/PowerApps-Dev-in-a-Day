# Low Code for Pro-Dev in a Day

### Overall Estimated Duration: 8 Hours

## Overview

In this series of labs, you will gain hands-on experience with various aspects of the Power Platform, from importing and running starting solutions to building and using custom code components. You will create and modify custom connectors, integrate Azure Functions, and promote solutions across environments. Each lab builds foundational skills, such as creating Power Apps components, setting up custom connectors, and managing solutions with GitHub. By following detailed instructions and visual aids, you will learn to effectively develop, test, and deploy robust Power Platform solutions, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the platform's capabilities and best practices.

## Objective

After completing these labs, you'll know how to import and customize solutions in Power Platform, build custom code components, and  create and integrate custom connectors. Learn to import and customize Power Platform solutions, create custom code components, and develop and integrate custom connectors. By the end of this lab, you will gain insights on:

 - **Getting started with Powerapps** : Learn to import a starting solution, add a new column, update the admin app, and test the Power Platform CLI.
 - **Build a code component** : Create a code component, implement its logic, integrate it into a canvas app, and add it to a solution.
 - **Custom connector for existing API** : Create, modify, and test a custom connector using an Open API definition, and integrate it with canvas apps and flows.
 - **Application lifecycle management** : Promote a solution to a test environment, configure a service principal, manage with GitHub, and set up a workflow for release.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- Basic knowledge of Power Platform and Power Apps.
- Access to Power Platform environment and Azure account.
- Understanding of APIs and custom component development
- Familiarity with GitHub and Git operations.
- Preparedness with necessary files, API definitions, and development tools.

## Architecture

In these labs, you'll follow a structured process to master key aspects of Power Platform development and management. You'll start by importing a pre-built solution, running a flow to add sample data, customizing it by adding a new column, and testing the Power Platform CLI using VS Code. Next, you'll build a code component with VS Code, integrate it into a canvas app, and add it to a solution. Then, you'll create a custom connector using an Open API definition, enhance it with custom code, and test it in both flows and canvas apps. After that, you'll create, implement, and publish an Azure Function, create a connector for it, and optionally integrate it into a canvas app. Finally, you'll promote a solution to a test environment, configure a service principal, manage the solution using a GitHub repository, and release it for testing. Each step is detailed with instructions and visual aids to ensure you gain practical experience with Power Platform's features.

## Explanation of Components

The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:

- **Power Platform Environment**: The central workspace where you import, manage, and customize solutions within the Power Platform. It provides the necessary tools and interface for developing and testing 
 various applications and components.
- **Visual Studio Code**: A versatile code editor used for developing custom code components and Azure Functions. It offers powerful extensions and integrations to streamline coding and debugging within the 
 Power Platform ecosystem.
- **Code Component**: Elements created to extend the functionality of Power Apps. These components involve writing and integrating custom logic, which enhances the capabilities and flexibility of canvas apps.
- **Custom Connector**: Tools that allow Power Platform apps to connect with external data sources via APIs. These connectors enable seamless integration of external data and services into Power Platform 
 applications.
- **Azure Function**: Serverless compute services that run code on-demand to perform various tasks. Azure Functions are integrated into Power Platform apps to add advanced, scalable capabilities and handle 
 specific operations.
- **GitHub**: A version control system for managing and tracking changes to solutions and code.
