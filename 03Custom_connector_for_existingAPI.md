# Lab 03 - Custom connector for existing API

## Estimated Duration: 130 minutes

Working as part of the PrioritZ fusion team you will be configuring a custom connector for an existing API. The team would like to add badging to the PrioritZ application to give credit to users when they have completed ranking an item. The team identified an existing API, but it doesn't have a Power Platform connector.

## Lab Objectives

- Exercise 1: Create Database in Default Environment 
- Exercise 2: Create Solution 
- Exercise 3: Create Custom Connector 
- Exercise 4: Add Custom Code 
- Exercise 5: Test Custom Connector 
- Exercise 6: Promote Solution to Test Environment

## Exercise 1 - Create Database in Default Environment 

In this exercise, you will create a Dataverse database in the test environment, which will be used to import the solution in the next exercises.

When you review the API, you see that it has four operations and uses API key authentication.

### Task 1: Create Database 

1. Navigate to the Power Apps maker portal.

         https://make.powerapps.com

1. Click on **Environment (1)** and select the pre-created development environment named **OTU WA HOL -<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> (default) (2).**

    ![](images/L03/db1a.png)

2. Select **Solutions** from the left-hand side menu of Power Apps.

3. Click on **Create a database** to create a Dataverse database.

    >**Note:** You can leave this browser tab open and continue with the next exercise, as Dataverse database creation will take some time.

## Exercise 2 - Create Solution

In this exercise, you will create a solution for the Contoso Badges custom connector. Currently, custom connectors must be in a separate solution from the apps and flows that use them.

### Task 1: Create a solution

1. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the Power Apps maker portal and select **Environments (1)**, make sure you are in your dev environment named **DEV_ENV_<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)**. 

         https://make.powerapps.com 

    ![](images/L03/dev11.png)

2. Select **Solutions** and click **+ New solution**.

    ![](images/L03/L03-solution.png)

3. Enter **Contoso Badges connector (1)** for Display name, select **Contoso Coffee (ContosoCoffee) (2)** for Publisher, and
    click **Create (3)**.
